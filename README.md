# Atliq HR Analytics Dashboard
The Atliq HR Analytics Dashboard is a Power BI project that enables the user to track the leave and work from home status of all employees in an organization. The dashboard visualizes the data from an employee CSV file and displays information such as who all employees were on different types of leaves or working from home on different dates since they joined.

The project uses Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to calculate and aggregate the data, providing valuable insights to the HR team. The dashboard can help HR professionals to identify trends, patterns, and issues related to employee leaves and work from home, and take appropriate actions to improve employee satisfaction and retention.

The Atliq HR Analytics Dashboard has a user-friendly interface that allows the user to filter data by employee name, department, leave or work from home type, and date range. The dashboard also includes charts and tables that show the distribution of leave and work from home types across departments and employees, the number of leaves or work from home taken by each employee, and the average number of leaves or work from home taken by employees in different departments.

To use the Atliq HR Analytics Dashboard, the user needs to provide an employee CSV file with relevant data such as employee ID, name, department, join date, and leave or work from home details. The project is designed to be scalable, allowing the user to add new data sources or modify the existing ones as per their requirements.

Overall, the Atliq HR Analytics Dashboard is a powerful tool for HR professionals who want to keep track of employee leave and work from home status and make data-driven decisions to improve organizational performance.
